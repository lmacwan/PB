        <treatmentContentText><![CDATA[<p>Here at Purity Bridge in Tunbridge Wells we have carefully selected the treatments we offer and the highly skilled practitioners who administer them. All products and treatments have a proven track record with regard to safety and high quality evidence of effectiveness. We have also been careful to choose therapies that complement one another and reach across the spectrum: from topical therapies, through to injectables, and other skin care treatments.</p>
<p>We are the destination of choice for lip fillers and botulinum toxin ("Botox") in Tunbridge Wells, Kent and Sussex as well as having expertise in thread vein removal (spider veins). We are also a centre for skin cancer and mole removal, scar revision and cosmetic plastic surgery procedures. These include cosmetic facial procedures, such as upper eyelid lifts and ear correction, as well as procedures on the body such as belly button reshaping, labiaplasty and nipple procedures - all under local anaesthetic.</p>
<p>Our Consultant Plastic Surgeons are fully accredited, and all hold substantive NHS consultant posts - a "kite mark" of quality in the UK. We are particularly privileged that the renowned Mr Marc Pacifico leads our team, accompanied by the talented Ms Nora Nugent. Both hold their NHS consultant posts at the world famous Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead.</p>
<p>Marc and Nora have a particular interest in <span>C<span>osmetic Facial Plastic Surgery</span> </span>(facelifts, mini-facelifts, eyelid lifts (blepharoplasty), nose jobs (rhinoplasty) and brow lifts); <span>Plastic Surgery to the Breast</span> (<a href="http://www.puritybridge.co.uk/treatments/cosmetic-surgery/breast-augmentation/" title="Breast augmentation">breast augmentation</a>, breast lift (<a href="http://www.puritybridge.co.uk/treatments/cosmetic-surgery/mastopexy/" title="Mastopexy">mastopexy</a>), breast reduction and the combination of breast augmentation with a lift (augmentation mastopexy); as well as <span>B<span>ody Contouring Plastic Surgery</span></span> (tummy tucks (abdominoplasty), liposuction, body lifts, arm lifts and thigh lifts).</p>
<p>We are also proud to have Dan Bateman, our <span><span>Dental Implant</span></span> expert resident with us.</p>
<p>We hope you find the website informative and useful, and please do get in contact to find out more about how we might be able to help you.</p>]]></treatmentContentText>

        <leftColumnContent><![CDATA[<p>Purity Bridge in the heart of Tunbridge Wells is the creation of Consultant Plastic Surgeon, Mr Marc Pacifico.</p>
<p>With Mr Pacifico's wealth of experience, and following years of listening to his patients, it became clear that many people considering both surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures would prefer not to see their practitioner in the hospital environment. While first class care is without doubt provided in the top regional hospitals it is not necessarily the right place for those wishing to discuss aesthetic treatments.</p>]]></leftColumnContent>
        <rightColumnContent><![CDATA[<p>Founding a clinic therefore that could offer the many beauty therapy and skin treatments that complement medical and surgical cosmetic procedures was the most natural step to take. It has enabled all procedures that do not require a hospital visit to be done in a private clinic environment...a safe and welcoming environment where clients can be assured of an exemplary standard of care by highly skilled and qualified practioners.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, in the whole of Kent and Sussex, there are no comparable independent practices run by a fully accredited Consultant Plastic Surgeon, which are able to provide such a bespoke service in a personal and discrete manner.</p>]]></rightColumnContent>

              <text><![CDATA[<p>Mr Marc Pacifico MD FRCS(Plast) has been described as one of his generation’s rising stars in plastic surgery. His academic, surgical and practice achievements include, amongst others, coming top in the UK’s consultant level plastic surgery examinations (being awarded the Gold Medal), the publication of over 50 international peer-reviewed papers, being a regular invited speaker at conferences and the opening of his own private clinic, Purity Bridge, alongside his busy NHS and private surgical practices. He has built his reputation on a combination of a high level of surgical skill, his artistic eye and his holistic, friendly approach to patient care. His particular areas of interest include plastic surgery to the face and breast, as well as body contouring surgery.The look Marc aims to achieve is a natural, fresh look, in all areas of aesthetic surgery. Marc particularly focuses on the care his patients receive pre- and post-operatively, in order to optimize the outcome of surgery and provide all under his care with a smooth recovery after their procedure. Marc recognizes the continuum between non-surgical and surgical techniques, using all available options to formulate a bespoke treatment plan for every individual. This process has been further enabled by the opening of his private clinic Purity Bridge in Tunbridge Wells, that provides the best level of care possible to his patients. The art of rejuvenation is not a “one stop shop” but rather a process, with the right procedure required at the right time for the right outcome. That means maintaining surgical results with specifically timed non-surgical interventions, as well as a global approach to the individual that is outcome driven. <a href="http://www.marcpacifico.co.uk" target="_blank" title="Marc Pacifico website">Marc Pacifico</a> is a fully accredited specialist in plastic surgery, and is on the Specialist Register in Plastic Surgery with the General Medical Council (number 4412407) and a member of BAAPS,BAPRAS and ISAPS.

              <text><![CDATA[<p>Ms Nora Nugent FRCS(Plast) has joined Purity Bridge where she offers an individually tailored modern plastic surgery practice. The cornerstones of her practice are good communication with you and meticulous attention to detail as she feels this is vital to your decision to undergo any treatment under her care. This ethos is continued from your first consultation through to the end of your treatment to ensure that you get the highest possible care and are fully supported during this time. Nora aims to provide you with a clear and honest opinion on your condition and will ensure that you have the opportunity to ask any questions you may have before proceeding with treatment. Nora graduated from medical school at University College Dublin and completed her specialist training in plastic surgery with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. To further develop her clinical expertise and skills, she then undertook specialist fellowships in North America and Australia. Training in advanced burn critical care and burn surgery (acute and reconstructive) was undertaken during her fellowship at Shriners Hospitals for Children – Galveston, Texas. Prior to taking up her consultant post in the Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, Nora obtained additional subspecialty training in Australia completing a plastic surgery fellowship at St. Vincent’s Hospital, Sydney which encompassed both aesthetic (cosmetic) surgery and reconstructive surgery (including microsurgery) and also a hand surgery fellowship with Victorian Hand Surgery Associates, Melbourne. This allows her to offer you a wide range of procedures across the spectrum of plastic surgery. She has experience in all areas of aesthetic surgery including breast, facial and abdominal surgery and strives to achieve a natural rejuvenated appearance for her patients. For some this may be a skin rejuvenation technique while for others surgery can be a better option. <a href="http://www.noranugent.co.uk" title="Nora Nugent website">Nora Nugent</a> is a fully qualified plastic surgeon with the FRCS (Plast) qualification and has specialist registration in plastic surgery with the General Medical Council. She is a member of BAPRAS and IAPS. Nora maintains a broad range of clinical interests within plastic surgery and regularly attends conferences within the specialty to keep up to date with evolving techniques and new developments in plastic surgery. She is also a member of multidisciplinary clinical groups overseeing the management of burns, skin cancer and lower limb injuries in the South East of England. While always looking for ways to improve the care she can provide, Nora will only offer new procedures once she is satisfied that they have been evaluated fully and offer a clear benefit to her patients.</p>]]></text>

          <pageContentText><![CDATA[<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Text With Heading" Heading="WHAT IS BOTULINUM TOXIN?" Text="Botulinum toxins (e.g. Botox™) are special proteins produced by the bacteria clostridium botulinum. They are agents that affect the nerves at the point where they enter muscles, and therefore prevent the muscles from working. These toxins highly effective when used in minute concentrated doses to relax muscles and soften wrinkles. The effects are not permanent, and last 3-6 months.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
Other brand names of botulinum toxin are available such as Xeomin® and Azzalure are available. At Purity Bridge we have chosen to use Botox®" /><?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Text With Heading" Heading="WHAT DOES IT INVOLVE?" Text="Botox is administered by an injection directly into the appropriate muscles, usually on the face. It is given with a tiny needle very precisely into various locations in the face. Most commonly it is given to the frown area in the middle of the forehead, and also to the crows feet area. The untreated areas continue to work normally.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
Rather than being painful most people describe toxin treatment as being a little uncomfortable. Some factors may make it feel more painful such as stress or hormonal fluctuations.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
We perform the procedure in our specialised treatment room at the clinic in Tunbridge Wells." /><?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Text With Heading" Heading="WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?" Text="Botulinum toxin works best in people with fine lines and few wrinkles, and can reduce the amount of wrinkling of the skin. If wrinkles are deep and well-established, Botulinum toxin will not work effectively.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
Regular Botox treatment over a period of 12-18 months will help to iron out these creases, but for a more immediate result other treatment options such as dermal fillers may be a better option.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
In addition Botulinum toxin will not erase the wrinkles caused by sun-damage. Other treatments to improve the quality of the skin such as chemical peels will provide more benefit.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
Regarding prevention, it makes sense that Botox can prevent wrinkle formation if it is started before fixed wrinkles establish. However there is a careful balance when deciding to treat younger patients – premature treatment can make someone look older rather than the more youthful look desired. Whether or not treatment is appropriate is always decided on an individual patient basis.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
Botulinum toxin may also be used to treat conditions such as hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating, often in the armpits or palms and soles)." /><?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Text With Heading" Heading="HOW LONG DOES THE PROCEDURE TAKE?" Text="The procedure is done on an outpatient basis and takes about 10-15 minutes, depending upon the number of injections needed.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
The effects will take 4-10 days to show, and we invite all patients back for a review appointment at 14-days post-treatment" /><?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Text With Heading" Heading="WHAT IS THE RECOVERY PERIOD?" Text="The injections feel a bit like a small mosquito bite and are not particularly painful. Afterwards, some small red marks are usually present for a short time, before they resolve." />]]></pageContentText>
          <faqContent><![CDATA[<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Accordian" heading="WHAT ARE THE SUCCESS RATES?" content="Botulinum toxin therapy has good success rates, which has made it a consistently popular treatment worldwide." /><?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Accordian" heading="WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER THE INJECTIONS?" content="You may return to normal activities immediately after the injections, as no anaesthetic has been used. Following the injections you should keep your head up and not stoop over or strain.

Do not manipulate or massage the treated area, as this may spread the Botox to neighbouring areas and cause unwanted effects.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
Light make-up may be applied 1-hour after the procedure.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
It can be helpful to excercise the non-treated facial muscles by frowning and smiling frequently" /><?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Accordian" heading="WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS?" content="Some people experience a mild headache after the procedure, so it is advisable to take some paracetamol prior to having the injections.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
The most common side-effect is tenderness at the injection sites, which resolves within the first 24-48 hours.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
Up to 25% of people develop a mild headache. This is associated with the injections rather than the Botox itself, and can be treated with Paracetamol if needed.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
Bruising is always a possibility, although we take every measure to avoid it by using extremely tiny needles
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
If Botox migrates to unwanted sites it can cause weakness and drooping of the eyebrow or eyelid, or facial asymmetry. This is very rare.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
As stated above, it is possible to under-correct or over-correct with Botox, which may require additional treatment 2-4 weeks after the initial appointment.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
Rarely patients can develop more generalised side-effects such as tiredness, nausea, dry mouth (common in patients taking anti-histamines), difficulties swallowing and eye problems.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
Allergic reactions to Botox are possible but extremely rare." /><?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="Accordian" heading="WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE BOTULINUM TOXIN?" content="Botox should not be administered to pregnant women, or to mothers who are breast-feeding.
Patients with certain conditions affecting the connections between nerves and muscles (such as Myaesthenia Gravis and Eaton-Lambert Syndrome) should not have Botox.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
People with a previous allergic reaction to botulinum toxin, or with allergies to egg or human albumin.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
People taking aminoglycoside antibiotics (such as gentamicin)
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
Anyone with a skin infection in the area to be treated.
&lt;&lt;P&gt;&gt;
Caution should be exercised in any patients taking blood-thinning medication such as Warfarin and Clopidogrel, simply due to the possibility of severe bruising." />]]></faqContent>

<p> </p>
<?UMBRACO_MACRO macroAlias="TextWithHeading" heading="Mr Marc Pacifico, Consultant Plastic Surgeon, commenting on Botox™ treatment" content="The introduction of Botox™ and other botulinum toxins revolutionised facial rejuvenation 10-15 years ago. Over that time it has gained an excellent safety record when used by experienced practitioners, and the effects can be subtle and fresh. There is no need for Botox™ treatment to result in a frozen look if not desired. It is an excellent wrinkle-reduction treatment, muscle-relaxing injection and overall rejuvenation tool. In addition, it can be used to reduce sweating in the armpits and palms &amp; soles if you suffer from problematic sweating in these areas. We perform a lot of Botox™ treatments at Purity Bridge in Tunbridge Wells, and have consistent positive feedback. Please ask for more information should you be interested" />

          <text><![CDATA[<p>Wrinkles and fine lines develop for a combination of reasons: intrinsic genetic ageing, loss of elasticity, poor hydration, sun damage, smoking and habitual facial expressions. While wrinkles can be viewed as signs of character and a life well lived; they are also associated with the loss of youth. Wrinkles can be static (evident at rest) or dynamic (evident on expression). Often dynamic wrinkles become static wrinkles over time. Wrinkles can broadly be treated by three techniques at Purity Bridge: <a href="/{localLink:2085}" target="_blank" title="Anti wrinkle injections">Wrinkle-relaxing injections</a>, in the form of botulinum toxin, are a highly effective way of reducing and softening facial wrinkles. Areas commonly treated include the forehead, around the eyes (crow’s feet) and the area between the eyebrows. However, other areas can also be treated using these muscle-relaxing injections, including fine lines around the mouth (vertical furrows, often caused by previous smoking), bunny lines (wrinkles at the top of the nose) as well as wrinkles and bands that appear on the neck (plastysma bands). <a href="/{localLink:2048}" target="_blank" title="Facial Fillers">Dermal fillers</a> are ideally suited to treat established static wrinkles and grooves in the face. Common areas to address with these hyaluronic acid fillers include the nose to mouth lines (nasolabial folds), lines around the mouth and established wrinkles between the eyebrows. <a href="/{localLink:2064}" target="_blank" title="Facial Peels">Customised facial skin peels</a> are an excellent technique for freshening and rejuvenating the face, neck and hands with resepct to fine lines. A course of chemical peels can smooth out fine lines and wrinkles very effectively. A <a href="/{localLink:2047}" target="_blank" title="Vampire facial therapy">vampire facelift</a> is another way of improving the quality and texture of the skin</p>]]></text>

          <text><![CDATA[<p>“Marionette lines” is a common term used to describe changes that occur on the chin area with facial ageing.The corners of the mouth begin to turn down and create a ‘sad’ or ‘grumpy’ appearance. Skin changes, changes in our jaw position and facial movement all contribute to the development of ‘puppet’ or ‘marionette’ lines. Non-surgical options to help address this area of concern and rejuvenate the lower face include: <a href="/{localLink:2048}" target="_blank" title="Facial Fillers">Dermal fillers</a> that can be used to soften the deep set lines as well as offer support to the corners of the mouth (addressing the sad look that can appear when the corners of the mouth droop). <a href="/{localLink:2085}" target="_blank" title="Anti wrinkle injections">Muscle-relaxing injections</a> can be used to weaken the muscles that pull down the corners of the mouth, to allow the corners to come up. <a href="/{localLink:2063}" target="_blank" title="Fine contour therapy thread lifting">Fine contour thread lifting</a> is a type of minimally-invasive facelift that will physically lift and support the jowls and is an ideal technique in this area.</p>]]></text>

          <heading><![CDATA[Smile creases and accordion lines]]></heading>
          <text><![CDATA[<p>Whilst smiling and laughing are infectious and keep people in a great mood, the downside is that these expressions result in fine lines and creases developing around the mouth due to repetitious muscle activity. We definitely don’t want people to stop making these expressions; however, it is very common for people to want to reduce the lines that become deeper over time. Simple procedures are often all it takes to soften the appearance and help prevent them from worsening. Fine lines developing on the cheeks have been coined ‘accordion’ lines due to their accordion like appearance that is accentuated when we smile. Volume loss in the cheek region and deterioration in skin quality contribute to the development of these lines and create an area many people dislike. Improving the skin quality and texture in this area is possible through non-surgical treatments. <a href="/{localLink:2085}" target="_blank" title="Anti wrinkle injections">Anti-wrinkle injections</a> can weaken the muscles that produce the fine lines around the mouth – when performed carefully they do not stop facial expressions, but simply soften the lines produced by these expressions <a href="/{localLink:2048}" target="_blank" title="Facial Fillers">Customised facial peels</a> are an excellent way of rejuvenating the skin and improving its quality. They will help to smooth out and soften fine lines in all areas of the face. <a href="/{localLink:2048}" target="_blank" title="Facial Fillers">Dermal fillers</a> also have a role in these areas by softening the deeper and more established lines</p>]]></text>

          <text><![CDATA[<p>Located between the eyebrows in both men and women is the glabella, otherwise known as the frown area. Whether it is a facial expression that comes from concentrating, anger, squinting or thinking, frown lines develop as a result of making the same movement over and over again. Gradually the lines become static and are evident at rest with no facial expressions. As these frown lines are associated with negative expressions like ‘anger’ and ‘dissatisfaction’, it is a common area to have treated to create a smoother, and more relaxed appearance. <a href="/{localLink:2085}" target="_blank" title="Anti wrinkle injections">Muscle-relaxing injections</a> into the frown area is an ever popular treatment. It reduces the muscle activity here, thereby softening the wrinkles. <a href="/{localLink:2048}" target="_blank" title="Facial Fillers">Dermal fillers</a> are used for more established static lines –hyaluronic acid filleris injected into the lines to fill out the grooves and soften the lines. In some cases a combination of both treatments is used – normally the muscle-relaxing injections are given first, and at further review after around 2-weeks, dermal filler can be used if still required.</p>]]></text>

Sun damage to the forehead can also produce fine lines that deepen over time. These lines are often more notable when wearing makeup and at the end of a long day.

          <text><![CDATA[<p>Spider veins (also called thread veins, telangiectasia or broken capillaries) are formed by the dilation of the small veins under the surface of the skin. Although they can appear anywhere on the body, spider veins are most commonly found on the face and legs. The exact cause of spider veins is not known, but contributing factors include heredity, local trauma and hormonal levels. Spider veins become more numerous with age, and mostly occur in women. Treating thread veins often gives people back the confidence to get back into shorts and skirts. <a href="/{localLink:2029}" target="_blank" title="Sclerotherapy">Sclerotherapy</a> is a reliable treatment for thread veins on the legs. Tiny injections are given into the broken blood vessels of a substance that blocks the blood flow, making them disappear. Several sclerotherapy sessions may be needed for each area. It is important to have a leg vein check by our Consultant Vascular Surgeon before your first treatment, to make sure there is no underlying cause for developing the thread veins. For facial thread veins, <a href="/{localLink:3064}" target="_blank" title="Thermavein Treatment">Thermavein</a>, is a specific targeted treatment that gives excellent results, using microwave technology.</p>]]></text>

          <text><![CDATA[<p>Skin pigmentation is caused by pigment cells (melanocytes) releasing melanin (pigment) – whether as a result of a sun tan, or as localised pigment spots (freckles or lentigines) or pigment patches (melasma). Different skin types are more prone to producing patches of pigmentation, and these can be stimulated by changes in hormones, trauma, and chemical alterations to the skin. Treatment methods for pigmentation patches will vary depending on the individual involved but they can include creams. Often referred to as sun spots, age spots and liver spots, pigmented lesions are often a concern for people who are looking at improving their complexion. After professional diagnosis, pigmented lesions can be treated and a clearer complexion maintained in the long term. <a href="/{localLink:2064}" target="_blank" title="Facial Peels">Customised chemical peels</a> used in conjunction with specialised medical grade skin care can help address pigment spots and patches. We use the Obagi range of medical grade skin care products at Purity Bridge which are excellent in the treatment of pigmentation spots. It is important to use strong sun protection during the treatment process to ensure the best possible result.</p>]]></text>

          <heading><![CDATA[Cheeks - deflated or poorly defined]]></heading>
          <text><![CDATA[<p>Often as we get older, we notice that our face isn’t as ‘full’ as it used to be and we seem to be deflating. The loss of facial volume is a normal part of ageing, but it can also affect people who are very athletic and have recently undergone weight loss. Cheeks are often associated with youth, and this deflation is often obvious and can be quite distressing for some individuals. Replacing this lost volume is possible, restoring a youthful appearance whilst maintaining a natural looking result. Creating a subtle enhancement can restore high cheek bones and lift a deflated face. <a href="/{localLink:2048}" target="_blank" title="Facial Fillers">Dermal fillers</a> are now available that specifically target these areas, and are designed to improve the contours of the cheek area. They can also be used to lift the deflated soft tissues of the face as well as smooth out wrinkles. In addition, <a href="/{localLink:2063}" target="_blank" title="Fine contour therapy thread lifting">fine contour thread lifting</a> can be used to lift and re-suspend the cheeks and jowl area producing a natural result.</p>]]></text>

          <heading><![CDATA[Lips - thin or poorly defined]]></heading>
          <text><![CDATA[<p>As we age, our lips start to lose volume and thin. In addition, some people have naturally thinner lips. <a href="/{localLink:2048}" title="Facial Fillers">Dermal fillers</a> are an effective treatment to shape, add volume, and better define the lips. Lip enhancement with these hyaluronic fillers can refine, fill, lift or plump the lips as well as re-define the shape of the lip or lip line. As we age, it often appears as though the top lip is getting thinner and losing volume. Dermal fillers can help to restore this volume and define the lip line. In some people, even a young lip may tend to disappear when smiling, so some gentle filling of the lip tissue can help create a more attractive or sensual lip. Different products can be used in the lips to achieve specific results. This will be discussed with you during your consultation. At Purity Bridge we like to take a conservative approach to restoring lost volume to the lips, to ensure you walk away with a natural looking result while addressing your concerns. Further dermal filler can always be added at another appointment, should more be desired.</p>]]></text>

          <heading><![CDATA[Bags and dark circles under the eyes]]></heading>
          <text><![CDATA[<p>Many people suffer from dark circles and bags under their eyes making them look ‘tired’ and ‘sad’, even after a good night’s sleep. There are many factors that contribute to the deterioration of this area including pigmentation, loss of elasticity, visible veins under the eyes, and a loss of volume creating a groove (known as the tear trough). If you are looking at non-surgical options to improve this area, an individualised treatment plan can be devised for you to address any of the contributing factors. Specialised <a href="/{localLink:2048}" target="_blank" title="Facial Fillers">dermal fillers</a> can be used to treat tear troughs in certain circumstances, and in addition, <a href="/{localLink:2064}" target="_blank" title="Facial Peels">customised skin peels</a> will help to refreshen and tighten the thin skin in this area. A course of peels will stimulate collagen production which will improve the skin quality and tighten the skin in this area.

          <text><![CDATA[<p>Pores are normally-occurring openings in the skin that allow us to sweat and also secrete protective oils. During puberty, pores often enlarge to handle the increased oil output from sebaceous glands. In women, particularly after pregnancy and later during the menopause, these pores often stay enlarged due to hormonal changes. The nose, forehead and chin are especially prone to developing enlarged pores because they contain moresebaceous glands than other area of the face. <a href="/{localLink:2064}" target="_blank" title="Facial Peels">Customised skin peels</a> can be used to reduce the size of the enlarged pores. A course of chemical peels is used to remove the debris from the skin surface as well as the upper layers of skin, stimulating new collagen production. This shrinks down the pore size as the skin rejuvenates. In addition, we recommend the Obagi range of medical grade skin products to maintain a healthy skin.</p>]]></text>

          <text><![CDATA[Skin cancer is unfortunately becoming more and more common.However,if most types of skin cancers are removed early enough, the prognosis is usually very good. There are three more common types of skin cancer – basal cell carcinoma (BCC, also known as rodent ulcers), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma (or malignant melanoma). The mainstay of treatment for all three types is surgical excision (minor surgery). At Purity Bridge, our consultant surgeons are all experts in treating skin cancer, and anyone diagnosed with skin cancer has their case discussed at the regional specialist skin multi-disciplinary team meeting (MDT). This is a group of specialists from different medical disciplines that meets every week to discuss everyone who has had a diagnosis of skin cancer. The aim is to formulate a bespoke treatment plan for each person that can result in the best possible treatment.]]></text>

          <heading><![CDATA[General skin lesions]]></heading>
          <text><![CDATA[<p>With an increase in the number of sunny holidays that are taken over the last few decades, we strongly recommend that you check your skin regularly and seek professional assessment by a qualified doctor without delay if any suspicious skin spots or lumps appear. Skin cancer is diagnosed by physical examination by a trained doctor and sometimes requires a biopsy. Other parts of your skin also need to be checked for suspicious lesions. Warning: pigmentation is a common cosmetic problem and dramatic improvements are achievable; however, pigmentation is also usually the first sign of early skin cancer. If treatment of a pigmented spot or patch is performed by someone without proper training in the signs of skin cancer then removal of the pigment may hide an otherwise detectable melanoma or other skin cancer. This is why skin lesions should not be initially treated using a laser unless there is confirmation that the lesion is benign. As skin cancers can be life threatening it is recommended that all assessment and treatment of pigmentation be performed in a medical facility. All consultants at Purity Bridge are specialists in skin cancer. If you feel you have a suspicious skin spot or lump this should be assessed without delay.</p>]]></text>

From there the underlying SMAS layer (the supporting layer of the neck and face) is pulled and lifted to refine and smooth the jawline. Alternatively, <a href="/{localLink:2063}" target="_blank" title="Fine contour therapy thread lifting">fine contour thread lifting </a>can be performed to lift and resuspend droopy ageing tissues. The treatment options will be discussed with you and the most appropriate will be recommended.</p>]]></text>

              <smartBlogBody><![CDATA[<p><img src="/media/35877/natural-post-treatment-smile-2.jpeg" alt="Umbraco.Web.PublishedCache.XmlPublishedCache.XmlPublishedProperty" /></p>
<p>Tooth loss is a common occurrence, with people living longer it will, unfortunately, become more prevalent.</p>
<p>Tooth loss results in bone loss and the general ageing of the face. Historically we used plastic removable dentures to replace missing teeth. Not only are they uncomfortable and unstable but they only have approximately 10% of the function of a normal tooth.</p>
<p>Why should we accept this?</p>
<p>Most of or socialising involves eating, be it a family event or a simple meal out with friends. The lack of confidence a denture gives is unacceptable to some people.</p>
<p>For the past 14 years I have had the pleasure of discarding dentures and replacing them with fixed dental implants. Be it a single tooth or multiple teeth the end result is the same; a fixed replacement for a missing tooth.</p>
<p>The difference that a fixed restoration makes is something that is always surprising. The resulting increase in function, confidence and enjoyment in eating is vast.</p>
<p>Would I have a denture? No way and thankfully neither do my patients.</p>

<p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1418420939956_11851" class="yiv1185916809MsoNormal"><span>On 10th and 11th October the Purity Bridge team went to the CCR Expo at Kensington Olympia in London. This is a large annual conference combining cosmetic &amp; reconstructive surgery with cosmetic medicine, all under one roof. There is also a large industry exhibition, demonstrations and masterclasses.</span></p>
<p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1418420939956_11861" class="yiv1185916809MsoNormal"><span>For our new clinic manager Sarona, this was her first time at an event like this. It was the perfect opportunity to meet some of the key product distributors who support us at Purity Bridge, providing everything from skincare to surgical instruments to post-surgical garments.</span></p>
<p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1418420939956_11863" class="yiv1185916809MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1418420939956_11866" class="yiv1185916809MsoNormal"><span>Marc Pacifico has been heavily involved in this year’s CCR Expo, chairing a session on non-surgical body contouring as well as giving a talk himself. The non-surgical body contouring session was particularly timely with the introduction of CoolSculpting at Purity Bridge. The over-riding view was that non-surgical techniques are not a replacement for liposuction, but allow us to offer a full spectrum of treatments – something suitable for every patient.</span></p>
<p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1418420939956_11868" class="yiv1185916809MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="yiv1185916809MsoNormal"><span>Marc’s talk was on bridging the divide between plastic surgery and cosmetic medicine. Historically the two professions have worked against each other rather than working together. At Purity Bridge we are proud to be an example of how working together allows us to offer patients a more comprehensive and individual treatment portfolio. Our cosmetic doctor, Sophie Shotter, will regularly refer patients to Marc for a surgical opinion. And vice versa Marc will often recommend treatments that Sophie can offer. Marc’s talk provided an insight into how the two can work alongside each other to give our patients more options.

<p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1418420939956_11871" class="yiv1185916809MsoNormal"><span>Sophie was asked to give a live demonstration about Thermavein on stage on Saturday. This treatment has been very popular at Purity Bridge since Sophie joined us in August, and is the gold-standard for treatment of facial thread veins. There were lots of questions for Sophie from a crowd who were wowed by the instant results they could see on the screen in front of them. See Sophie’s demonstration here: </span><a id="yui_3_16_0_1_1418420939956_11874" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj5rJQAg4Xk" target="_blank"><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj5rJQAg4Xk</span></a></p>]]></smartBlogBody>

              <smartBlogBody><![CDATA[<p><img src="/media/35876/blog-2.jpg" alt="Umbraco.Web.PublishedCache.XmlPublishedCache.XmlPublishedProperty" />Last week saw our VIP CoolSculpting launch at Purity Bridge. We are all very excited at the arrival of this innovative, non-invasive body sculpting technique.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CoolSculpting</strong> is still relatively new to the UK, and involves freezing fat cells in order to kill them. A single treatment decreases a fat deposit by on average 33%. It can be used to treat arms, back fat, stomach, love handles, inner and outer thighs, and the male chest. It is the only device which is FDA cleared in the United States (where the technology was designed), and has unique safety features as well as maximum results.</p>
<p>Our guests were welcomed with drinks and canapés, followed by a live demonstration. Our model Lucy had her stomach treated, which involves applying a vacuum applicator. This applies a strong suction to suck the fat into an applicator, before starting the freezing process. An hour later the applicator is removed, and there were lots of ‘wows’ when everyone saw the frozen area formed on Lucy’s stomach, and surprise at just how cold it felt!</p>
<p><strong>Dr Sophie Shotter</strong>, our cosmetic doctor, then gave a talk about the science behind CoolSculpting, the process involved and showed some impressive before and after photographs. She was joined by Tim Stevens, a representative from CoolSculpting, who told our guests a little about the company’s background and the research that went into the machine. </p>
<p>Sophie then gave one to one consultations for people interested in the treatment and their suitability for it.</p>
<p><strong>CoolSculpting</strong> is now available at Purity Bridge – call us to book your free consultation on 01892 536960</p>]]></smartBlogBody>
